Innerloop versus outerloop
==========================

In a devfile spec, there are two scopes of deployment: innerloop and outerloop. Having these scopes is essential for a full development experience as well as ensuring proper integration of the full scope of development tools for Kubernetes and OpenShift projects.

What is innerloop?
------------------

**Innerloop** deployments are actions the developer makes within their development environment, such as running tests, debugging, and local deployments before checking into the target source repository.

### Procedure

1.  Add the runtime container component for running your project with the `schemaVersion` and `metadata` definitions
    
    *   This example will use `nodejs-18` UBI image

      ```yaml
        schemaVersion: 2.3.0
        metadata:
          name: nodejs
        components:
          - name: runtime
            container:
              image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/nodejs-18:latest
              args: ['tail', '-f', '/dev/null']
              memoryLimit: 1024Mi
              mountSources: true
      ```
    
2.  If your project needs ports to be forwarded like in this example, define the endpoints required for your project
    
    *   **Note**: If you are using odo v3, you need to create an additional endpoint for the debugging port.
    *   The environment variable definition `DEBUG_PORT` is to set the debug port of the node application
    
      ```yaml
        components:
          - name: runtime
            container:
              image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/nodejs-18:latest
              args: ['tail', '-f', '/dev/null']
              memoryLimit: 1024Mi
              mountSources: true
              env:
                - name: DEBUG_PORT
                  value: '5858'
              endpoints:
                - name: http-node
                  targetPort: 3000
                - exposure: none
                  name: debug
                  targetPort: 5858
      ```
    
3.  Now the runtime component has been defined, we need a way of running our project
    
    1.  Add a command to `npm install` our project packages and mark it as our projects build command
    2.  Add another command to run the main process or the server process `npm start` in this example and mark it as our projects run command
    3.  With these commands you should now be able to run a development deployment of your project, for example `odo dev`
    
      ```yaml
        commands:
          - id: install
            exec:
              component: runtime
              commandLine: npm install
              workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
              group:
                kind: build
                isDefault: true
          - id: run
            exec:
              component: runtime
              commandLine: npm start
              workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
              group:
                kind: run
                isDefault: true
      ```
    
4.  For testing and debugging we will also need to define commands for each with the shell commands used to debug and test your project
    
    *   The `kind` of commands will be `debug` and `test` for running your debugging and testing respectively
      ```yaml
        commands:
          - id: install
            exec:
              component: runtime
              commandLine: npm install
              workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
              group:
                kind: build
                isDefault: true
          - id: run
            exec:
              component: runtime
              commandLine: npm start
              workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
              group:
                kind: run
                isDefault: true
          - id: debug
            exec:
              component: runtime
              commandLine: npm run debug
              workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
              group:
                kind: debug
                isDefault: true
          - id: test
            exec:
              component: runtime
              commandLine: npm test
              workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
              group:
                kind: test
                isDefault: true
      ```
    

#### Final innerloop devfile


```yaml
    schemaVersion: 2.3.0
    metadata:
      name: nodejs
    components:
      - name: runtime
        container:
          image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/nodejs-18:latest
          args: ['tail', '-f', '/dev/null']
          memoryLimit: 1024Mi
          mountSources: true
          env:
            - name: DEBUG_PORT
              value: '5858'
          endpoints:
            - name: http-node
              targetPort: 3000
            - exposure: none
              name: debug
              targetPort: 5858
    commands:
      - id: install
        exec:
          component: runtime
          commandLine: npm install
          workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
          group:
            kind: build
            isDefault: true
      - id: run
        exec:
          component: runtime
          commandLine: npm start
          workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
          group:
            kind: run
            isDefault: true
      - id: debug
        exec:
          component: runtime
          commandLine: npm run debug
          workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
          group:
            kind: debug
            isDefault: true
      - id: test
        exec:
          component: runtime
          commandLine: npm test
          workingDir: ${PROJECT_SOURCE}
          group:
            kind: test
            isDefault: true
```

The component and commands here allow the developer to build, run, debug, and test their project within a local cluster using a devfile supported development tool (e.g. `odo`).

What is outerloop?
------------------

**Outerloop** deployments are ones done after the development stage once the source is checked into the source repository. Such deployments would include integration testing, full builds or deployments.

### Procedure

1.  Add an image component to define the image building process
    
    1.  Label your image tag with `imageNameSelector`
    2.  Define your `dockerfile` with your file path, build context and if your build requires root privileges
      ```yaml
        components:
          - name: outerloop-build
            image:
              imageNameSelector: landingpage-image:latest
              dockerfile:
                uri: docker/Dockerfile
                buildContext: .
                rootRequired: false
      ```
    
2.  Add a command which will instruct your deployment to build the docker image using the `image` component
      ```yaml
        commands:
          - id: build-image
            apply:
              component: outerloop-build
      ```
    
3.  Add a deployment component that best suits your clusterâ€™s runtime environment (`kubernetes`/`openshift`), in this case openshift
    
    *   Provide the file path to your openshift template file with `uri`
      ```yaml
        components:
          - name: outerloop-build
            image:
              imageNameSelector: landingpage-image:latest
                dockerfile:
                  uri: docker/Dockerfile
                  buildContext: .
                  rootRequired: false
          - name: outerloop-deploy
            openshift:
              uri: landingpage-template.yaml
      ```
    
4.  As with the image component, we will need to create a command for the openshift component
      ```yaml
        commands:
          - id: build-image
            apply:
              component: outerloop-build
          - id: deploy-openshift
            apply:
              component: outerloop-deploy
      ```
    
5.  To complete the deployment process, combine the two commands into a complete deploy command using composite
      ```yaml
        commands:
          - id: build-image
            apply:
              component: outerloop-build
          - id: deploy-openshift
            apply:
              component: outerloop-deploy
          - id: deploy
            composite:
              commands:
                - build-image
                - deploy-openshift
              group:
                kind: deploy
                isDefault: true
      ```
    

#### Final outerloop devfile

```yaml
    schemaVersion: 2.3.0
    metadata:
      name: nodejs
    components:
      - name: outerloop-build
        image:
          imageNameSelector: landingpage-image:latest
          dockerfile:
            uri: docker/Dockerfile
            buildContext: .
            rootRequired: false
      - name: outerloop-deploy
        openshift:
          uri: landingpage-template.yaml
    commands:
      - id: build-image
        apply:
          component: outerloop-build
      - id: deploy-openshift
        apply:
          component: outerloop-deploy
      - id: deploy
        composite:
          commands:
            - build-image
            - deploy-openshift
          group:
            kind: deploy
            isDefault: true
```

With these components and commands, the developer can produce a full build and deployment. In this case, the project has an OpenShift deployment template `landingpage-template.yaml` for a full deploy and docker image build file `docker/Dockerfile` for a full build. These actions can also be used for the requirements of performing integration testing.

Support list of developer tools
-------------------------------

Though the devfile spec does support both [innerloop](/docs/2.3.0/innerloop-vs-outerloop#what-is-innerloop) and [outerloop](/docs/2.3.0/innerloop-vs-outerloop#what-is-outerloop) deployments, not all developer tools will support these deployments in the same way. This section will list the devfile supported development tools and what deployment scopes they support.

### Developer Tools

| Tool                             | Innerloop Support | Outerloop Support         |
|----------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Odo v2                           | X                 | X                         |
| Odo v3                           | X                 | X                         |
| Eclipse Che                      | X                 |                           |
| Amazon CodeCatalyst              | X                 |                          |
| JetBrains Space Cloud Dev        | X                 | X (image build only)      |
| Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces     | X                 |                           |
| OpenShift Dev Console            |                   | X                         |
| VSCode OpenShift Toolkit         | X                 | X                         |
| IntelliJ OpenShift Toolkit       | X                 | X                         |


Odo Spec Support
----------------

Odo covers the features supported by the devfile 2.2.0 spec with minor requirements for version 3:

1.  In order to debug your project it is required to define a debug port: [https://odo.dev/docs/user-guides/v3-migration-guide#changes-to-the-way-component-debugging-works](https://odo.dev/docs/user-guides/v3-migration-guide#changes-to-the-way-component-debugging-works)
2.  By default, odo v3 sets up an underlying persistent volumes rather than setting up ephemeral volumes, this can be toggled back: [https://odo.dev/docs/user-guides/v3-migration-guide#ephemeral-storage](https://odo.dev/docs/user-guides/v3-migration-guide#ephemeral-storage)

More information on how `odo` treats lifecycle events can be found on the [odo v2](https://odo.dev/docs/2.5.0/tutorials/using-devfile-lifecycle-events) page or on the [odo v3](https://odo.dev/docs/user-guides/advanced/using-devfile-lifecycle-events) page.

**OpenShift Toolkit** for both VSCode and IntelliJ IDE use odo v3 to power the core commands, therefore the devfile support should be the same as odo v3.

Eclipse Che Spec Support
------------------------

As shown in the previous table Eclipse Che only supports [innerloop](/docs/2.3.0/innerloop-vs-outerloop#what-is-innerloop) spec features and is currently working on support for [outerloop](/docs/2.3.0/innerloop-vs-outerloop#what-is-outerloop). The Eclipse Che project provides an updated support list of Devfile 2.x in an issue: [https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/17883](https://github.com/eclipse/che/issues/17883)

**Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces** upstreams the Eclipse Che project and therefore should provide the same level of devfile support.

OpenShift Dev Console Spec Support
----------------------------------

OpenShift Dev Console allows the deployment of samples and only supports devfiles defined for [outerloop](/docs/2.3.0/innerloop-vs-outerloop#what-is-outerloop) deployments. Additional information about this can be found: [https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/applications/creating\_applications/odc-creating-applications-using-developer-perspective.html](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/applications/creating_applications/odc-creating-applications-using-developer-perspective.html)

Amazon CodeCatalyst Spec Support
--------------------------------

Amazon CodeCatalyst uses devfile specification 2.1.0 and it therefore does not support features the latest devfile specification provides, such as [outerloop](/docs/2.3.0/innerloop-vs-outerloop#what-is-outerloop) deployments. More information about Amazon CodeCatalystâ€™s utilization of devfiles can be found on their documentation pages: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/devenvironment.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/devenvironment.html)

JetBrains Space Cloud Dev Spec Support
--------------------------------------

JetBrains Space Cloud Dev uses the 2.2.0 devfile specification and supports the use of multiple devfiles in a single project. It uses a custom `space` field under the top level `attributes` to define the setup for the runtime environment to be set up on the platform. An example of a devfile you might see in this environment is shown below:

#### Example of JetBrains Space Cloud Dev devfile setup

```yaml
    schemaVersion: 2.2.0
    metadata:
      name: 'My custom dev env configuration'
    attributes:
      space:
        # regular, large, xlarge
        instanceType: large
        # a default IDE for the project
        editor:
          # (Required) IDE type: Idea, WebStorm, PyCharm,
          # RubyMine, CLion, Fleet, GoLand, PhpStorm
          type: Idea
          version: '2022.1'
          # Space uses JetBrains Toolbox App to install IDEs to a dev environment.
          # updateChannel defines IDE version release stage: Release, EAP
          updateChannel: EAP
          # JVM configuration (appends to the default .vmoptions file)
          vmoptions:
          - '-Xms2048m'
          - '-Xmx4096m'
        # a warm-up snapshot
        warmup:
          # create a snapshot every Sunday (only for main branch)
          startOn:
          - type: schedule
            cron: '0 0 0 ? * SUN *'
          # run additional warmup script (IDE indexes will be built anyway)
          script:
            ./scripts/warmup.sh
        # Parameters and secretes required by a dev environment
        # e.g., credentials to an external service
        requiredParameters:
        # (Required) the name of the environment variable
        # that will be available in the dev environment
        - name: USERNAME
          description: 'Space username'
        requiredSecrets:
        - name: PASSWORD
          description: 'Space permanent token'
    components:
    - name: dev-container
      # Dev environment container config
      container:
        # use image from a Space Packages registry
        image: mycompany.registry.jetbrains.space/p/myprj/container/my-dev-image:27
        # environment variables
        env:
          - name: API_URL
            value: 'https://my-site/http_api'
          - name: PATH_IMG
            value: './img/'
```

JetBrains Space Cloud Dev also partially supports [outerloop](/docs/2.3.0/innerloop-vs-outerloop#what-is-outerloop) via the `image` component to set up `Dockerfile` builds:

#### Example of JetBrains Space Cloud Dev image build devfile setup

```yaml
    schemaVersion: 2.2.0
    attributes:
      space:
        instanceType: large
        editor:
        type: Idea
    components:
    - name: image-build
      image:
        # (Required)
        imageName: my-image:latest
        dockerfile:
          # (Optional) path to Docker context relative to projectRoot
          # by default, projectRoot is repository root
          buildContext: docker
          # (Required) path to Dockerfile relative to projectRoot
          uri: docker/Dockerfile
          args:
          - 'ARG1=A'
          - 'ARG2=B'
```

The `image` component build process publishes the built image to a cluster image registry specific to your project workspace. More details about using devfiles with JetBrains Space Cloud Dev can be found here: [https://www.jetbrains.com/help/space/set-up-a-dev-evnvironment.html](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/space/set-up-a-dev-evnvironment.html)


Referring to a parent devfile
=============================

This section describes how to designate a parent devfile to a given devfile. If you designate a parent devfile, the given devfile inherits all its behavior from its parent. Still, you can use the child devfile to override certain content from the parent devfile. If you override the correct content, you can reuse the same parent devfile in multiple other devfiles. If you do reuse a parent devfile, the parent turns into a stack that is used in multiple other devfiles.
    

Procedure
---------

You can refer to a parent devfile in three different ways:

*   `id`
    
*   `uri`
    
*   `kubernetes`
    

### Parent referred by registry

Using the `id` when published in a registry. Provide the `registryUrl` as well as `version`. `version` can be either the stack version string, or `latest`. If no `version` is provided, the default version for the stack will be used.

#### Parent referred by registry

```yaml
    schemaVersion: 2.2.0
    metadata:
      name: my-project-dev
    parent:
      id: nodejs
      registryUrl: https://registry.devfile.io/
      version: 2.0.0
```

### Parent referred by URI

Using the URI when published on a static HTTP server, such as GitHub Gist or Pastebin.

#### Parent referred by URI

```yaml
    schemaVersion: 2.2.0
    metadata:
      name: my-project-dev
    parent:
      uri: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devfile/registry/main/stacks/nodejs/devfile.yaml
```

### Parent identified by a Kubernetes resource

Using a Kubernetes resource name and namespace if it has been deployed on a Kubernete cluster.

#### Parent identified by a Kubernetes resource

```yaml
    schemaVersion: 2.2.0
    metadata:
      name: my-project-dev
    parent:
      kubernetes:
        name: mydevworkspacetemplate
        namespace: mynamespace
```
    
Extending kubernetes resources
==============================

This section describes how you can extend Kubernetes resources for container components through `pod-overrides` and `container-overrides` attributes.

`container-overrides` attributes allow you to override properties of a container in a pod spec such as `securityContext` and `resources`. However, it restricts from overriding properties such as `image`, `name`, `ports`, `env`, `volumesMounts`, `command`, and `args`.

This attribute can be defined at the component level.

### Procedure

1.  Specify "container-overrides" at the component level.
    
    #### Specify container-overrides to override security context for container at component level
    
      ```yaml
        schemaVersion: 2.3.0
        components:
          - name: maven
            attributes:
              container-overrides:
                securityContext:
                  runAsUser: 1001
                  runAsGroup: 1001
            container:
              image: eclipse/maven-jdk8:latest
      ```
    
The data inside `container-overrides` can also be specified as a JSON.

  ```yaml
    container-overrides:
      securityContext: {"runAsUser": 1001, "runAsGroup": 1001}
  ```

pod-overrides
-------------

`pod-overrides` attribute allow you to override properties of a pod spec such as `securityContext`, `serviceAccountName`, `schedulerName`, etc. However, it restricts overriding properties such as `containers`, `initContainers`, and `volumes`.

This attribute can be defined at the component and devfile attributes levels. If it is defined at both the levels, the attribute at the devfile attributes level will be parsed first and then the component level.[Strategic Merge Patch](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-api-machinery/strategic-merge-patch.md#basic-patch-format) strategy is used to merge the attributes defined at both the levels.

### Procedure

1.  Specify "pod-overrides" at the component level.
    
    #### Specify pod-overrides to override security context for container at component level
    
    ```yaml
        schemaVersion: 2.3.0
        components:
          - name: maven
            attributes:
              pod-overrides:
                spec:
                  serviceAccountName: new-service-account
            container:
              image: eclipse/maven-jdk8:latest
    ```
    
2.  Specify "pod-overrides" at the devfile attributes level. It will be defined as a top-level attribute.
    
    #### Specify pod-overrides to override resources for container at the devfile level
    
    ```yaml
        schemaVersion: 2.3.0
        attributes:
          pod-overrides:
            spec:
              serviceAccountName: new-service-account
        components:
          - name: maven
            container:
              image: eclipse/maven-jdk8:latest
      ```
    

The data inside `pod-overrides` can also be specified as a JSON.

  ```yaml
      pod-overrides:
        spec: {"serviceAccountName": "new-service-account"}
  ```
