# What is a devfile - Docs
You can use devfiles to automate and simplify your development process by adopting the existing devfiles that are available in the public community registry or by authoring your own devfiles to record custom instructions to configure and run your build environment as a YAML-formatted text file. You can make these devfiles available in the supporting build tools and IDEs that can automatically process the devfile instructions to configure and build a running application from a development project.

Using the recommended best practices from the devfile, the tools and IDE can:

*   Take in the repository hosting your application source code.

*   Build your code.

*   Run your application on your local container.

*   Deploy your application to cloud-native containers.
