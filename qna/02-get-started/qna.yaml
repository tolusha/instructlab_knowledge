  - context: Devfile validation rules are designed to ensure that configurations are well-structured and align with Kubernetes standards. These rules enforce naming conventions for fields like id and name, which must use lowercase alphanumeric characters with optional dashes and be no longer than 63 characters. At the component level, names must be unique, and containers must be properly configured with valid volume mounts and environment variables. Commands require unique IDs and must follow type-specific rules for exec, apply, and composite commands. Endpoint ports need to be uniquely defined across container components unless dedicated pods are used. Additional validation covers events, plugin components, image definitions, and project configurations to maintain overall schema consistency and integrity.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the regex pattern used to validate `id` and `name` fields in a Devfile?
        answer: The regex pattern is `^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?$`.

      - question: What are the character and format restrictions for `id` and `name` fields?
        answer: The fields must be lowercase, no special characters except dash(-), must start and end with an alphanumeric character, and be limited to 63 characters.

      - question: Can two container components have the same `targetPort` in their endpoints?
        answer: No, unless the container components have `dedicatedPod` set to `true`, container components must have unique `targetPort` values.
      - question: Can a `composite` command reference itself?
        answer: No, a `composite` command cannot reference itself directly or indirectly through its subcommands.
      - question: What kind of components can an `apply` command target?
        answer: An `apply` command can target `container`, `kubernetes`, `openshift`, or `image` components.
