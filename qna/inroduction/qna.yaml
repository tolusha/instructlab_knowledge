      Devfiles are YAML-formatted text files used to automate and simplify development processes by
      configuring and running build environments. They can be sourced from public community
      registries or authored for custom configurations.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is the format used for devfiles?
        answer: Devfiles are YAML-formatted text files.
      - question: Where can developers find existing devfiles?
        answer: Developers can find existing devfiles in public community registries.
      - question: Can developers create their own devfiles?
        answer: Yes, developers can author their own devfiles for custom configurations.
  - context: >-
      Devfiles can be integrated into supporting build tools and IDEs to automate the
      configuration and building of applications directly from development projects.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What tools can process devfile instructions?
        answer: Supporting build tools and IDEs can process devfile instructions.
      - question: What is the role of devfiles in development projects?
        answer: Devfiles automate the configuration and building of applications from development projects.
      - question: Can devfiles be used with IDEs?
        answer: Yes, devfiles can be used with IDEs to automate processes.
  - context: >-
      Supporting tools and IDEs use devfile instructions to build the source code of applications hosted in repositories.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What do devfile-supported tools use to build applications?
        answer: They use devfile instructions to build applications.
      - question: What input do devfiles require for building applications?
        answer: Devfiles require the repository hosting the application source code.
      - question: Can devfiles handle source code directly from repositories?
        answer: Yes, devfiles can handle source code from repositories.
  - context: >-
      Devfiles enable running applications locally in containers as part of the development process.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: Where can applications configured by devfiles run during development?
        answer: Applications can run locally in containers.
      - question: Are devfiles capable of configuring a local container environment?
        answer: Yes, devfiles can configure a local container environment.
      - question: What is the purpose of running applications locally using devfiles?
        answer: It is part of the development process to test and build applications.
  - context: >-
      Devfiles support the deployment of applications to cloud-native containers as part of the development lifecycle.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What type of deployment can devfiles support?
        answer: Devfiles support deployment to cloud-native containers.
      - question: Are cloud-native deployments part of the devfile capabilities?
        answer: Yes, devfiles can deploy applications to cloud-native containers.
      - question: What is one of the deployment environments enabled by devfiles?
        answer: Cloud-native containers are one of the deployment environments enabled by devfiles.
